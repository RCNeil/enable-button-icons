A plugin to modify the Wordpress `core/button` block to include icons based on Nick Diego's (@ndiego) original plugin example - https://github.com/ndiego/enable-button-icons

Notable changes:
⋅⋅* There is an icons folder within the plugin directory. Upload your SVG's there.
⋅⋅* The PHP will generate the markup on both the backend and frontend to implement them 

Modify the CSS for your needs.
